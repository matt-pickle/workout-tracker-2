WHAT IT DOES
This improves on my first workout tracker app by adding a user account system that tracks each user's progress in a central database so it can be used by the same person on multiple devices, or by multiple people using a single device.

WHAT I LEARNED
Setting up an Express app to serve a React front end
MongoDB and Mongoose
CRUD operations
Web token authentication
Password encryption
